Welcome. This is Yoga Nidra for sleep.

[pause 3 seconds]

Lie down on your back. Make any final adjustments to become completely comfortable. Once settled, allow your body to become still.

[pause 5 seconds]

Close your eyes gently. Release any effort. You are here to rest. Nothing else matters.

[pause 5 seconds]

Begin with three deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose.

[pause 4 seconds]

Exhale completely through your mouth, letting everything go.

[pause 3 seconds]

Inhale again, filling your lungs.

[pause 4 seconds]

Exhale slowly. Feel your body becoming heavier.

[pause 3 seconds]

One more deep breath in.

[pause 4 seconds]

And release. Let your breathing return to its natural rhythm.

[pause 6 seconds]

Feel the weight of your body pressing down. Notice every point of contact with the surface beneath you. Your heels. Your calves. Your thighs. Your hips. Your back. Your shoulders. Your head. All supported. All held.

[pause 6 seconds]

Now we will relax the body completely, part by part.

[pause 3 seconds]

Feel both feet. All ten toes. The soles. The heels. Let them become soft and heavy.

[pause 5 seconds]

Your ankles relax. Your calves release all tension. Your knees soften. Your thighs become heavy. Both legs are now completely relaxed.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your hips release. Your lower back melts into the surface beneath you. Your belly is soft. Rising and falling naturally.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your chest is open. Your heart is calm. Your upper back releases. Your shoulders drop completely.

[pause 5 seconds]

Both arms relax. From shoulders to fingertips. Heavy. Warm. Still.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your neck softens. Your throat relaxes. Your jaw unclenches. Your face becomes smooth and peaceful.

[pause 5 seconds]

Your eyes rest. Your forehead is calm. The top of your head releases.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your entire body is now relaxed. Heavy. Warm. Floating in stillness.

[pause 8 seconds]

Now bring your attention to your breath. Do not change it. Simply observe. Notice the gentle rhythm. The soft rise and fall.

[pause 6 seconds]

We will count breaths backward from ten to one. With each breath, you will drift deeper into rest.

[pause 4 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Ten.

[pause 4 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Nine. Deeper now.

[pause 4 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Eight. Letting go.

[pause 4 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Seven. So peaceful.

[pause 4 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Six. Sinking deeper.

[pause 4 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Five. Halfway to sleep.

[pause 5 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Four. So calm.

[pause 5 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Three. Almost there.

[pause 5 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. Two. Nearly asleep.

[pause 5 seconds]

Breathe in. Breathe out. One. Deep rest.

[pause 8 seconds]

You are now in the threshold between waking and sleeping. This is the place of perfect rest. Perfect peace.

[pause 6 seconds]

There is nothing to do. Nothing to remember. Nothing to plan. Just this moment. Just rest.

[pause 8 seconds]

Allow yourself to drift. Into stillness. Into silence. Into deep, peaceful sleep.

[pause 6 seconds]

Sleep now. Rest completely.

[pause 12 seconds]

Welcome to Yoga Nidra for deep, restful sleep.

[pause 3 seconds]

Find your most comfortable position, lying on your back. Let your body settle completely into the surface beneath you.

[pause 4 seconds]

Allow your arms to rest alongside your body, palms facing upward. Let your legs fall open naturally, feet dropping to the sides.

[pause 5 seconds]

Close your eyes. Give yourself permission to do nothing. To simply receive. To let go.

[pause 6 seconds]

Take a slow, deep breath in, filling your lungs completely.

[pause 4 seconds]

And release. Let everything go with this exhale.

[pause 4 seconds]

Again. Breathe in deeply.

[pause 4 seconds]

And exhale fully, releasing any remaining tension.

[pause 5 seconds]

Now allow your breath to find its own natural rhythm. There is nothing to control. Nothing to change. Simply witness each breath as it comes and goes.

[pause 8 seconds]

Begin to notice the weight of your body. Feel how gravity gently pulls you downward. You are fully supported. Completely safe.

[pause 6 seconds]

We will now travel through your body, inviting each part to release, to become heavy, to let go completely.

[pause 4 seconds]

Bring your awareness to your right foot. The toes. The sole. The heel. Feel your right foot becoming heavy. Relaxed. Sinking.

[pause 6 seconds]

This heaviness rises through your right ankle. Your right calf. Your right knee. Heavy. Relaxed. Letting go.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your right thigh becomes heavy. Your entire right leg, from hip to toes, is now deeply relaxed. Heavy. Still. At peace.

[pause 7 seconds]

Shift your attention to your left foot. The toes. The sole. The heel. Your left foot becomes heavy. Completely relaxed.

[pause 6 seconds]

The heaviness moves up through your left ankle. Your left calf. Your left knee. So heavy. So relaxed.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your left thigh releases. Your entire left leg is now heavy. Relaxed. Melting into stillness.

[pause 7 seconds]

Both legs are now completely relaxed. Heavy. Warm. At rest.

[pause 6 seconds]

Bring your awareness to your pelvis and hips. Feel them becoming heavy. Releasing all tension. Sinking deeper.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your lower back softens. Any tightness dissolves. Your entire lower body is heavy. Deeply relaxed.

[pause 7 seconds]

This wave of relaxation moves into your belly. Your abdomen is soft. Rising and falling gently with each breath. No effort. Just ease.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your chest is open. Relaxed. Your heart beats slowly, steadily. You are calm. You are safe.

[pause 7 seconds]

Feel your upper back releasing. Your shoulder blades melt into the surface beneath you. Heavy. Supported. At peace.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your shoulders drop away from your ears. All the weight they carry dissolves. They are light yet heavy. Free.

[pause 7 seconds]

This relaxation flows down your right arm. Through your upper arm. Your elbow. Your forearm. Into your right hand. Your fingers. Heavy. Warm. Tingling.

[pause 7 seconds]

Now your left arm. The heaviness travels down. Your upper arm. Your elbow. Your forearm. Your left hand. Your fingers. Heavy. Relaxed. Still.

[pause 7 seconds]

Both arms rest heavy at your sides. Your entire body from shoulders to fingertips is deeply relaxed.

[pause 6 seconds]

Bring your awareness to your neck. Feel the muscles softening. All tension drains away. Your throat is open. Relaxed.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your jaw unclenches. Your lips part slightly. Your tongue rests softly in your mouth. Your entire mouth is relaxed.

[pause 6 seconds]

The muscles around your eyes become smooth and soft. Your eyelids are heavy. Pleasantly heavy.

[pause 6 seconds]

Your forehead is calm. Smooth. All worry fades away. Your scalp relaxes. The crown of your head is at peace.

[pause 7 seconds]

Your entire body is now deeply relaxed. Heavy. Warm. Completely at rest. You are floating in perfect stillness.

[pause 10 seconds]

Now imagine yourself in a place of complete peace. Perhaps a quiet meadow under the stars. Or floating gently on calm, warm water. Whatever feels safest. Most peaceful.

[pause 8 seconds]

In this place, there is no time. No worry. Only peace. Only rest. You belong here.

[pause 10 seconds]

I will now count slowly from ten down to one. With each number, you will drift deeper. Closer to sleep. Closer to perfect rest.

[pause 4 seconds]

Ten. Drifting deeper.

[pause 4 seconds]

Nine. Letting go completely.

[pause 4 seconds]

Eight. So peaceful. So heavy.

[pause 4 seconds]

Seven. Sinking into stillness.

[pause 4 seconds]

Six. Deeper and deeper.

[pause 4 seconds]

Five. Halfway to sleep.

[pause 4 seconds]

Four. Almost there now.

[pause 4 seconds]

Three. So calm. So peaceful.

[pause 4 seconds]

Two. Nearly asleep.

[pause 4 seconds]

One. Complete relaxation. Complete peace.

[pause 8 seconds]

You are now in the space between waking and sleeping. The most restful place. Allow yourself to remain here. Or drift gently into deep, natural sleep.

[pause 6 seconds]

There is nothing more to do. Nothing more to hear. Only rest. Only peace.

[pause 6 seconds]

Sleep now.

[pause 15 seconds]

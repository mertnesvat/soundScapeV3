Welcome to this Yoga Nidra practice for deep sleep.

[pause 2 seconds]

Lie down comfortably on your back. Let your arms rest by your sides, palms facing up. Allow your legs to fall open naturally.

[pause 3 seconds]

Close your eyes. You have nothing to do. Nowhere to be. Simply listen and let go.

[pause 4 seconds]

Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose.

[pause 3 seconds]

And exhale completely, releasing all tension.

[pause 3 seconds]

Let your breathing become natural and effortless. Each exhale takes you deeper into relaxation.

[pause 5 seconds]

Now bring your awareness to your body. We will move through each part, inviting it to become heavy and relaxed.

[pause 3 seconds]

Feel your feet. Your toes, your soles, your heels. They are heavy. Completely relaxed. Sinking into the surface beneath you.

[pause 5 seconds]

This heaviness moves up through your ankles, your calves, your knees. Your legs are heavy. Deeply relaxed.

[pause 5 seconds]

Feel your thighs becoming heavy. Your hips. Your lower back melting into the bed. So heavy. So relaxed.

[pause 5 seconds]

Your belly is soft. Your chest is open. Each breath feels effortless now.

[pause 5 seconds]

Your shoulders drop away from your ears. Heavy. Releasing all tension they've been holding.

[pause 4 seconds]

This relaxation flows down your arms. Through your elbows. Your wrists. Into your hands and fingertips. Heavy and warm.

[pause 5 seconds]

Feel your neck relax. Your jaw unclenches. Your tongue rests softly in your mouth.

[pause 4 seconds]

The muscles around your eyes become smooth. Your forehead is calm and peaceful. Your entire face is soft.

[pause 5 seconds]

Your whole body is now heavy. Deeply, deeply relaxed. You are safe. You are at peace.

[pause 6 seconds]

Now I will count slowly from ten down to one. With each number, you will sink deeper into peaceful rest.

[pause 3 seconds]

Ten. Sinking deeper.

[pause 3 seconds]

Nine. Letting go completely.

[pause 3 seconds]

Eight. Drifting peacefully.

[pause 3 seconds]

Seven. So calm. So heavy.

[pause 3 seconds]

Six. Deeper and deeper.

[pause 3 seconds]

Five. Halfway there.

[pause 3 seconds]

Four. Almost asleep now.

[pause 3 seconds]

Three. So peaceful.

[pause 3 seconds]

Two. Nearly there.

[pause 3 seconds]

One. Complete relaxation.

[pause 5 seconds]

You are floating in perfect stillness. There is nothing to do. Nowhere to go. Allow yourself to drift into natural, restful sleep.

[pause 6 seconds]

Sleep now. Sleep deeply.

[pause 10 seconds]
